                <p>A website, also written as Web site,[1] web site, or
                    simply site,[2] is a set of related web pages containing content
                    (media) such as text, image, video, audio, etc. A website is
                    hosted on at least one web server, accessible via a network such
                    as the Internet or a private local area network through an
                    Internet address known as a Uniform Resource Locator. All
                    publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World
                    Wide Web.</p>
                <p>A webpage is a document, typically written in plain text
                    interspersed with formatting instructions of Hypertext Markup
                    Language (HTML, XHTML). A webpage may incorporate elements from
                    other websites with suitable markup anchors.</p>
                <p>Webpages are accessed and transported with the Hypertext
                    Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption
                    (HTTP Secure, HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user
                    of the webpage content. The user's application, often a web
                    browser, renders the page content according to its HTML markup
                    instructions onto a display terminal.</p>
                <p>The pages of a website can usually be accessed from a simple
                    Uniform Resource Locator (URL) called the web address. The URLs
                    of the pages organize them into a hierarchy, although
                    hyperlinking between them conveys the reader's perceived site
                    structure and guides the reader's navigation of the site which
                    generally includes a home page with most of the links to the
                    site's web content, and a supplementary about, contact and link
                    page.</p>
                <p>Some websites require a subscription to access some or all of
                    their content. Examples of subscription websites include many
                    business sites, parts of news websites, academic journal
                    websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, message boards,
                    web-based email, social networking websites, websites providing
                    real-time stock market data, and websites providing various other
                    services (e.g., websites offering storing and/or sharing of
                    images, files and so forth).</p>
